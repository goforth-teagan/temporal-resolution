# temporal-resolution
This repositoty is a compilation of files used in an analysis of IPM's temporal resolution. 

To perform analyses, first start with the Initial Data Load file. The output files will be placed in a folder on your Desktop. Then, run the IPM_Approach, with load, solar, and wind profiles (comment and uncomment profile being used). Then do the same for the Day_Type approach file. Again, these outputs will be placed in folders on your desktop. 

To do the error analysis, run the Error_Analysis file for all three profiles. Then run the Plots file to visualize the error and data produced. The plots and error analysis files will also be placed in files on your desktop. 

For further analysis, the regional approaches file can be used to aggregate the data in different regions, and then run again through the profiles to see if they performed better.
